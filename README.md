## Abstract

"The amount of data generated by individuals and enterprises is growing exponentially
over the last decades, which empowers the use of machine learning methods since, for
statistical purposes, the more data a model can have access to, the more accurately it will
predict or represent reality. The problem emerges when the model must deal with sensitive
data such as medical records, financial history, or genomic data, in which additional care
must be taken in order to protect the privacy of data owners. Encrypting sensitive data
might appear a good solution at first sight, but it can considerably limit the ability to do
statistical analysis. This work is a survey on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), a
special kind of cryptography scheme that still permits some machine learning methods to
run over encrypted data, while it has strong mathematical guarantees of privacy protection."
