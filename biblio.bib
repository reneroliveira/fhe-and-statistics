We use Gentry's technique to construct a fully homomorphic scheme from a ``bootstrappable'' somewhat homomorphic scheme. However, instead of using ideal lattices over a polynomial ring, our bootstrappable encryption scheme merely uses addition and multiplication over the integers. The main appeal of our scheme is the conceptual simplicity.",

abstract = {An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ≡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

We provide a detailed security analysis of concrete instantiations, and give a high-performance software implementation that exploits the inherent parallelism of the FFT algorithm. The throughput of our implementation is competitive with that of SHA-256, with additional parallelism yet to be exploited.",

abstract = {Our main result is a reduction from worst-case lattice problems such as GapSVP and SIVP to a certain learning problem. This learning problem is a natural extension of the “learning from parity with error” problem to higher moduli. It can also be viewed as the problem of decoding from a random linear code. This, we believe, gives a strong indication that these problems are hard. Our reduction, however, is quantum. Hence, an efficient solution to the learning problem implies a quantum algorithm for GapSVP and SIVP. A main open question is whether this reduction can be made classical (i.e., nonquantum).We also present a (classical) public-key cryptosystem whose security is based on the hardness of the learning problem. By the main result, its security is also based on the worst-case quantum hardness of GapSVP and SIVP. The new cryptosystem is much more efficient than previous lattice-based cryptosystems: the public key is of size \~{O}(n2) and encrypting a message increases its size by a factor of \~{O}(n) (in previous cryptosystems these values are \~{O}(n4) and \~{O}(n2), respectively). In fact, under the assumption that all parties share a random bit string of length \~{O}(n2), the size of the public key can be reduced to \~{O}(n).},

The problem has been shown to be as hard as worst-case lattice problems, and in recent years it has served as the foundation for a plethora of cryptographic applications. Unfortunately, these applications are rather inefficient due to an inherent quadratic overhead in the use of LWE. A main open question was whether LWE and its applications could be made truly efficient by exploiting extra algebraic structure, as was done for lattice-based hash functions (and related primitives).",

It supports an approximate addition and multiplication of encrypted messages, together with a new rescaling procedure for managing the magnitude of plaintext. This procedure truncates a ciphertext into a smaller modulus, which leads to rounding of plaintext. The main idea is to add a noise following significant figures which contain a main message. This noise is originally added to the plaintext for security, but considered to be a part of error occurring during approximate computations that is reduced along with plaintext by rescaling. As a result, our decryption structure outputs an approximate value of plaintext with a predetermined precision.",
